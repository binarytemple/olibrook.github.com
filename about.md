![Me!](/images/oli-2.jpg)
As a bit of an all-rounder, I'm most happy when I get to switch between
roles on a job â€” front-end, back-end, sysadmin and design. I like to
think I have a good sense of the craft of web development as a whole and
I enjoy what I do.


After finishing my degree at Sussex University I worked for a small
outfit in London called Emak Mafu, where I worked on Actionscript 3
apps, before a stint at [Amp London](http://www.amp-london.com) where I
began working on Django apps with an increasing focus on web standards.
Since 2010 I have been freelancing, specializing in Django, Python and
related technologies. I've been collaborating with [Cure
Studio](http://curestudio.com) on an ongoing basis and have just
finished a 5-month contract at
[Imagination](http://www.imagination.com).

-----------------------------

Not really a good measure of a developer, but this is a list of
technologies with which I have **commercial** experience:

- Python, Django and related packages (South, Fabric, PIP, Virtualenv, etc.)
- Test-driven development using Nose
- HTML, CSS and Javascript (not *just* jQuery plugins!)
- Actionscript 3
- Relational and non-relational databases (MySQL, CouchDB)
- Experience building and consuming REST APIs
- Continuous integration using Jenkins / Hudson
- Sysadmin (mostly Ubuntu on a VPS like [the one used for this site](http://www.linode.com/)). Including:
  - Puppet (solo, using Vagrant)
  - Bash, SSH and Vim
  - Apache, NGINX, Supervisord and repository hosting using [mercurial-server](http://www.lshift.net/mercurial-server.html)
- Git, Mercurial, Subversion
- UML, wireframing and prototyping using Poseidon, Omnigraffle, Balsamic etc.
