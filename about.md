A bit of an all-rounder, I'm most happy when I get to switch between
roles on a job â€” front-end, back-end, sysadmin and design. I like to
think I have a good sense of the craft of web development as a whole and
I enjoy what I do.

The obligatory list-o'-acronyms!
--------------------------------

Not necessarily the best measure of a developer, here's a list of
technologies with which I can legitimately claim to have commercial
experience:

- Python
- Django and related packages
  - South
  - Fabric
  - PIP
  - Virtualenv
- Hand-made, standards-compliant front-end trickery:
  - HTML (including 5!)
  - CSS (including 3!)
  - Javascript (doesn't absolutely have to mean jQuery!)
- Actionscript 3
- Unix sysadmin, mostly Ubuntu on a VPS like
  [the one used for this site](http://www.linode.com/). Includes:
  - Bash, SSH and Vim
  - Administration of virtual hosts under Apache or NGINX
  - Repository hosting using [mercurial-server](http://www.lshift.net/mercurial-server.html)
  - Git, Mercurial, Subversion
- UML, wireframing and prototyping using Poseidon, Omnigraffle, Balsamic etc.
- Regular Expressions
