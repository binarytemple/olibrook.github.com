The Gillespies site was one of the larger projects we built during my
stint at Emak Mafu. After building much of the front end back in 2009
Gillespies approached me again once Emak Mafu had closed their doors to
look at replacing the proprietary CMS used by Emak Mafu with a Django
based solution.

So my work is divided into two parts. The front end looks something like
this...

and the refactored back end, which looks something like this...

The Django refactor involved reverse-engineering Django models from the
MySQL database tables, extensive South migrations to whip the schema
into shape and implementing a AMF service API using PyAMF.
