So, I'm fairly late to the party, but you have to start somewhere.

opportunity to do anything more exciting with the new spec. professionally.

I figure that perhaps if I start experimenting in my own time I'll be
able to get my skills up naturally, even if my first attempts are lame.

And so, here's the first of my little experiments, knocked up in an hour
or two on a Thursday afternoon:
