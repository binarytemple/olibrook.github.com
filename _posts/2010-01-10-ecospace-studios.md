So this was the first time at Amp we had a stab at using Django in
production. Looking back, I made some pretty horrendous design decisions
(I'll tell you in person if you like), but it was a success overall and
the team at Amp enjoyed the experience â€“ enough to consider themselves a
genuine little Django shop from that point onwards.
