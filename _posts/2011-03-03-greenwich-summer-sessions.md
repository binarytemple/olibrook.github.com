The Greenwich Summer Sessions is an annual concert series now in its
second year. Cure Studio were commissioned to build the website this
year and to look after much of the festival's online marketing efforts.

I've been responsible for all development work on the site with Cure
Studio providing unique designs and illustrations for the site, which I
think work really well. It's also nice to walk around town in Greenwich
(where I grew up) and to see pieces of work up on the walls that I've
contributed to in some way!

Cure Studio's work on the site was recently featured in Computer Arts
Magazine, which is terribly exciting.
