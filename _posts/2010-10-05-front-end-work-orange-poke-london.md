Now, this may not look like much, but it marks a pretty early venture
into new territory for me (HTML, web standards etc.), having focused
mostly on Actionscript and back end Django work until this point
professionally.

It was kind of intimidating doing even a tiny bit of front end work at
Poke, considering the super-high quality of their work, but I survived
and they fed me several delicious lunches. I appreciated those a lot.
