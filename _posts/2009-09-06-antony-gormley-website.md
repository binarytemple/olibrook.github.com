The Antony Gormley site was the largest and most rewarding piece of work
we did during my time at Emak Mafu. The main challenge for the site was
finding a way to structure Antony Gormley's huge body of work in such a way
that it would be quick for a user to find any specific piece, as well as
providing engaging and entertaining of browsing work for folks looking to
while away the day. The site looks pretty spectacular, which is obviously
helped by the content itself.

Technically this was the most difficult site we built at Emak Mafu. I led
front end development on the site, which required a substantial refactor of
an internal framework in use at Emak Mafu, along with the development of a
very light weight set of UI components which allow fluid resizing of content
on the site efficiently.

The site made the Official Honoree list at the 2010 Webby Awards.
