So, when James at Cure Studio got in touch with me last year about
building the Simon Dance Design site, he asked if I could build it in
Expression Engine, because Cure Studio had had some experience with it
and they liked it. "Sure!", I said, "anything for you, Jimbo". So now
I've built a site in EE.

While in retrospect I don't have anything nice to say about Expression
Engine, I do have many nice things to say about working with James at
Cure, the super design work he does over there and the super minimalist
designs he pulled out on this particular occasion.
